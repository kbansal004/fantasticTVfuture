** TV Forecast Model **

The problem that the client was facing was current tool helps only in flight planning and optimizations. It did not provide the estimated outcomes by network for next month’s plan. So, client wanted to know that if they plan to spend for example:$100 on one TV channel then how much leads can they get approximately. Also which channels are saturated that even if they spend more there will be no returns and which have a bandwidth where they can increase their budgets. I ran scripts in R to ingest historical data and give a holistic view of networks using Tableau dashboard. Computed max number of spots, CPC, CPL etc. by network by unit length and daypart for the upcoming month.

How to run the code?

Step 1. Please download the TV_Tool_Input.csv and TV_plan_for_TV_Stations.csv files in your local system.
Step 2. Note the file path where you have saved the file.
Step 3. Mention the path in the beginning of code where setwd is written. It's the first line of code setwd("F:\\TV_Planning_Forecast")
Step 4. Please change the "/" to "\\" otherwise the code will throw error.
Step 5. Yes, now you are ready to run the code.
Step 6. After the code is run successfuly there be an output file generated by the name TV_Tool_output.csv in your mentioned location.


Please Note: The data used for analysis is generated randomly so results might be little skewed or numbers might look unbelievably large or small.
